.container {
    color: red;
    background-color: yellow;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 20px;
}
/*this is how they did it
.container .text {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: #E00000;
  font-size: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
  AGAIN, I did not read the instructions all
  the way but I still got the intended result.
  I got lucky because there aren't that many 
  different classes in the html"
