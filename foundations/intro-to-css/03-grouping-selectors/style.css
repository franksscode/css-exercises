.black {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
}

.yellow { 
    background-color: yellow;
}

.one {
    font-size: 28px;
    font-family: Hevetica, "Times New Roman", sans-serif;
}

/*ok so in the solution, they wrote
.black,
.yellow {
  font-family: Helvetica, "Times New Roman", sans-serif;
  font-size: 28px;
} which does the same thing as the code
 I wrote BUT, I didnt read the instructions
 well enough and that's why I wrote
 it the way I did. I still got the
 intended result which is what matters*/
